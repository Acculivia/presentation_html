# presentation_html
~~~
--2015.10.25--
This HTML page is, for a presentation, on an English class. Well, you can say, I was to showing off.

As you see, It's October 25th and here I've add English content in this readme. In fact the presentation has ended a lot of time ago. That little class was over in September, and what I need to do in my next English class is sit quietly and watch others' presentation which is presented with PPTs.

In fact, mostly previous updates on Chinese contents are not covered in this English content. In there I've written how I changed my files or added a folder or some complaints. Which is not what I want and need to translate here.

So mainly it's about how to act confidently while you are talking to others. If you should wondering what's the meaning of the words inside, while these "cards" are not "flipped", well, it matters very little. It's my first project on HTML, and I'm appreciating the movements of these elegant elements when I'm coding for this, as well as bugs, bugs, and bugs.

I've also got help from others for that because, you know, inside this page nowhere else but a function is about to use javascript to complete it. The rest is CSS and pure html, which is what I've learnt better of.

After the successful presentation, my English gave a comment of "almost perfect", as me and in fact, more on my partener, couldn't speak English fluently. We've made interaction with audiences, we've prepared well and we didn't completely read all thing on some paper or this. After all I told him not to do that and nor did I, and there isn't anything that can be read just from the HTML page. Yet it seemed that she left no attract on my HTML page, which is what I was surprised of.

I've also asked one of my friend to give comment to my little project, and his review is, well, the combination of colors is bad. All right, maybe I've made my colors too dark yet not pure dark, I thought.

I always feel excited when I come and find this well-saved on GH. And thanks for reading this readme! Enjoy and feel free to leave comments!

All right... after I've written these I think that maybe I need to learn how to use markdown. Or maybe Github doesn't show it well but how knows. Orz.

So what I've view on the main page is these lines won't automatically start a newline...orz

英语课装逼用html，取代PPT。
内容是如何演讲得自信，然而这一切并没有什么卵用。
因为打算在台上说所以并不会对这个html做太多的工作（或者因为懒？）

增加了一个test文件夹，里面是用来解决卡片双面翻转会出现的的问题的&花了一个下午的时间解决orz（不过这个问题听上去不是很简单的么？！！）
不论如何貌似这还是一个半成品我要调色要再调整圆角边框……
然后就是，同学还说这个应该导向下一个页面（？）
背面的灰色丑死了……
……这次遇到了我最讨厌的BUG那就是打错字了还半天找不出来！！

其实在上一次更新以后就已经快到presentation的时候了，然后我现在才回来更新。我这一次其实就是更新了上面的英文内容而已，其实英文内容和中文内容之间还是有些些差别的对吧~
当时候的presentation被老师评价为“几近完美”，然后实际上老师并没有花多少注意在我的HTML上面，而是吐槽我和其实主要是我的同学他英语不够流利有些结巴。
那么事情已经过去很久了。我想我也没有什么说的了。感谢欣赏我的这个处女作品&请多多指教！~

然后……orz
怎么md的文件会显示成为一行就是一行而不是自动换行的啊…………
